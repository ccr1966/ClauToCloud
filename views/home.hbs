            <h2>Wellcome</h2>
            <p>I have over twenty years of experience in software development. I have covered several roles in which
                 I was able to get adapted to the dynamics of the different changes in programming languages 
                 (from sequential programming, through structured programming, 4GL languages, event-driven languages,
                  web technologies and finally object oriented languages, and from flat files to relational databases), 
                  offering to my employers the capacity and initiative of self-learning and on the-job training.
                   During the last years, my professional development had an impasse due to my maternity leave.
                An important part of my career has been developed in remote modality, always getting very good feedback from my clients and employers.
                For family needs, I resided, in 2008, three months in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, United States. In 2010, I lived three months in Rayon, Thailand. In 2018, spent one month in Houston, United States. All these cases gave me the opportunity to enhance my English skills and exposed me to personal relationship with people from different cultures.
                I have Argentine and Italian citizenship.
                </p><p>At the moment I am training in Node, trying to become a Sr full stack NodeJs developer.</p>
